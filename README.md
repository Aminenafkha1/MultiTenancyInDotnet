## Overview

The Multi-Tenancy Project is a .NET application that demonstrates the implementation of multi-tenancy using the ASP.NET Core framework. The project allows you to create a multi-tenant application where each tenant has its own isolated data and configuration settings.

## Multi-Tenancy

In a multi-tenant architecture, the application serves multiple tenants, isolating their data and providing separate functionality for each tenant. This project showcases the following aspects of multi-tenancy:

✨ **Separate Data:** Each tenant has its own data storage, ensuring data isolation and security.

🔌 **Shared Application:** The application code and logic are shared among tenants, reducing redundancy.

💼 **Tenant Identification:** Tenants are identified based on their unique identifier (ID) or subdomain.

🚀 **Scalability:** The architecture allows for easy scaling to accommodate growing tenant base.
